\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a new compilation language, ADD-L, which combines ADD and implied literals to optimize the search process in the first stage of accurate Shannon entropy computation. 
In the second stage of accurate Shannon entropy computation, we optimize model counting queries using shared component cache.
We integrated preprocessing, heuristic, and other methods into the precise Shannon computation tool PSE, with its trace corresponding to ADD-L. 
Experimental results demonstrate that PSE significantly enhances the scalability of precise Shannon entropy computation, even outperforming the state-of-the-art entropy estimator EntropyEstimation in overall performance.
We believe that PSE has opened up new research directions for entropy computing in Boolean formula modeling, such as caching schemes, variable heuristics, preprocessing, etc.
We look forward to designing more suitable techniques for Shannon entropy computation in the future, in order to further enhance the scalability of precise Shannon entropy.
